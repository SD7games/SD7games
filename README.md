### Unity / C# Game Developer (Finland 🇫🇮)

Focused on **gameplay programming** and **modular architecture**.  
In my main project (**Emoji Battle**) I apply **MVC-style separation** and the  
**Single Responsibility Principle** to keep gameplay logic, UI and infrastructure clearly separated.

I build complete features end-to-end: gameplay mechanics, progression systems,  
UI flows, saving logic and basic AI behaviour — from idea to a playable, testable state.  
I learn fast through practice, refactor actively, and grow through **complete, playable projects**, not isolated demos or code snippets.

| Project | Platform | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Emoji Battle** *(Main Project)* | Android (in dev) | Turn-based mobile game **fully refactored** to an **MVC-style architecture** with clear separation between domain logic and UI, AI difficulty via `Strategy` pattern, emoji unlock progression, JSON saving and UI popups. |
| **Sharp Shooter** | WebGL | FPS prototype with ScriptableObject-based weapons, ADS, sprint, recoil, NavMesh AI and win/lose flow. |
| **Royal Run** | WebGL | Endless runner with procedural obstacles, collectibles, speed scaling and short-session gameplay loop. |
| **Rocket Boost** | WebGL | Physics-based rocket controller: thrust, torque, collisions and restart cycle. |
| **Galaxy Strike** | PC | Timeline-driven cinematic demo with camera transitions, dialogue portraits and scene flow. |
