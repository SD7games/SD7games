# 👋 Hi, I'm Oleksandr Tokarev  
### Unity / C# Game Developer (Finland 🇫🇮)

Junior Unity / C# Developer focused on **gameplay programming** and **clean, modular architecture**.  
I build gameplay systems and prototype full features in Unity 6: mechanics, progression, UI flows,  
saving systems and simple AI behaviour. I learn fast through practice, finish features to a playable state  
and continuously grow through shipped results.
